# Pandora's Labyrinth

Fight your way through the Labyrinth in this isometric, top-down, dungeon crawler as you conquest towards finding Pandora's Box hidden deep inside! Beware of the Minotaur lurking in the depths, those who encounter rarely survive to tell the tale..

A crossover inspired by 'The Minotaur's Labyrinth' & 'Pandora's Box' from Greek Mythology.

This project was initiated as an end of year 1 submission for my Games Design course at University of the Arts London (UAL). As my first large project, it was daunting at first. Organising my ideas into a steady work flow over time became natural, I would formulate my ideas based on the capabilities of my coding skills, although still quite ambitious at the time.

Learning the process from start to finish of developing a game, solo, has become invaluable. There were so many things I hadnâ€™t thought of previously, for example: resets, saving progress, matching the difficulty to a novice player and even making the controls as simple as possible. As a learning curve, not just in code but the production, has made this project insanely fun to work on. Seeing how the project started to how it ended has shown me that nothing is impossible in games design and that we are only limited to our imaginations. A lesson I shall hold on to for the many years to come!

Limitations of this project:

As a submission, I was only allowed to use the functionality of c#, removing the use of Unity systems like; Colliders (other than sprite intersects), 3rd-party plugins, Tile Maps and anything similar. Everything from mechanics and physics to artwork and production has been self produced with the exception of sound effects and music which had been outsourced with permission or licensing of use.
